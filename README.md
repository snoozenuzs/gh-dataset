Creation of 3 predictive machine learning models based on sample patients data

Development and optimisation of 3 machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree 
and random forest) to predict those who have diabetes (gh >= 6.5%) using Python in a Jupyter 
notebook. Accuracy of the prediction models are evaluated and hyper tuned.
